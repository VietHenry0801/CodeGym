    <!-- <h1>The 20 Best Visual Studio Code Extensions for Front End Developers</h1>
    <p class="color" id="t1">Great tooling can help developers write faster, cleaner, and more consistent code. Visual Studio Code extensions allow you to add tools, languages, debuggers, and more, to help you do just that. A while back, I asked front end developers here at Shopify
        what extensions, packages, and plugins they couldn’t live without.</p>
    <p class="color">ased on those conversations, I wrote two articles about the best Sublime Text plugins and the best Atom packages for front end developers. In this article, I’ve highlighted my top picks for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions, and broken them
        down into the following six categories. If you want to ensure that what you're building is secure, you can also check out our article on how to improve your client’s website security.</p> -->
